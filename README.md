# github-profile

Coding Challenge
Using the GraphQL GitHub API (<https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/>), recreate your github profile page (the tab that lists your repositories).

What you SHOULD include:

1. The responsive design of the website. Make your recreation as close to the real website as possible
2. The profile picture and basic description of the account
3. 20 repositories (maximum)

See an example of what the final result should look like - <https://res.cloudinary.com/bitkoin/image/upload/v1605131940/frontend_dev_example.png>

What you should NOT include:
1. Pagination/Search functionality - you should load the first 20 repositories only.
2. The other tabs (e.g. Overview, Projects, Packages).
3. The graph showing year of activity for the repository
Other requirements:

- Do not use any CSS or JS framework
- Host your site somewhere (e.g. Netlify or Github Pages)
